# Mean-Shift-Segmentation
Segmentation of image regions using Mean Shift algorithm

Parametric segmentation techniques such as Optimal Thresholding are faced with mainly two problems - (1)
assumption that gray levels follow Gaussian distribution and (2) the need to compute a number of parameters
of a pre-determined probability density function. 

Mean Shift Segmentation is an elegant technique which over-
comes these problems by avoiding estimation of probability density function altogether. It is a non-parametric
technique which can analyze complex multi-modal feature space and works by iterative shifts of each data point
towards it's local mean.
